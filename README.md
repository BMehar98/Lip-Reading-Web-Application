LipNet: Lip Reading with Deep Learning
LipNet Demo (Optional: Add a GIF or image showing the project in action)

LipNet is a deep learning model for lip reading (converting silent lip movements into text). This implementation is based on the LipNet paper and adapted for real-time inference using Streamlit.

Features
🎥 Video Input Processing – Works with pre-recorded videos or real-time webcam input.

🤖 Deep Learning Model – Uses a 3D CNN + LSTM architecture for sequence prediction.

🚀 Streamlit Web App – Easy-to-use interface for testing the model.

📊 Pre-trained Weights – Supports loading pre-trained models for quick inference.

📥 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package manager)

FFmpeg (for video processing)

Steps
Clone the repository

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained weights (if applicable)

Place the model weights (lipnet_model_weights.h5) in the models/ folder.

(Alternatively, train the model yourself—see Training.)

Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run app/streamlitapp.py
🖥️ Usage
Running the Web App
Start the Streamlit server:

streamlit run app/streamlitapp.py
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

Upload a video file or use a webcam to test the model.

Command Line Inference

python predict.py --video_path "data/sample.mp4"
🏋️ Training (Optional)
If you want to train the model from scratch:

Download the dataset (e.g., GRID Corpus).

Preprocess the videos and alignments:


python preprocess.py --data_dir "data/"
Train the model:


python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
FileNotFoundError: ..\data\s1	Ensure the data/ folder exists and contains the dataset.
ModuleNotFoundError	Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install missing packages.
CUDA errors (GPU issues)	Install correct tensorflow-gpu version or run on CPU.
